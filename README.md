## Not your mama's datepicker/calendar UI thing ##

This project aims to answer the question:

> Why are calendars paged? Why can't we just scroll through like a normal
> document?

Most datepickers and calendar representations are paged by month. Since months
don't always end on the same day of the week (eg Sept ending on a Tuesday and
Nov ending on a Thurs), the last week usually has the first few days of the next
month until the end of the week (Sat or Sun).

However, to actually see the next month you have to actually page to the next
month.  Why can't we just scroll down? Why can't calendars behave like normal
documents and just continue to scroll? Why does my mother hate me?
